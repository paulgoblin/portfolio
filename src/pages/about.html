My name is Paul Richter. I'm a JavaScript web developer living in Freemont, CA. I work primarily with the MEAN stack, but Iâ€™m comfortable with most any JavaScript. Code is a product that is touched by programmers, clients, and users. I write code to address the needs of all three. I code because I love to build good products! Be sure to check out [my work](/index.html).

Before web development, I earned my BS in civil engineering from Cornell University. There, I worked as a researcher, writing simulations of internal gravity waves in Fortan 95 and analyzing data in MATLAB. (Check out my [APS conference presentation](/assets/img/APSNov19.pdf)). Since then, I have spent a year crossing the US in a zero-cost urban survival journey, worked as a bike mechanic in Los Angeles, and worked as a designer/builder of furniture at DeJong and co, a small custom furniture company.

I am available for hire. Here is my [resume]({{pageInfo.resumeLink}}). Email me if you have good problems.
