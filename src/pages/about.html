I'm a JavaScript developer living in the SF bay area. Currently, I work at Edison Pharmaceitcals to build browser tools that help scientists run experiments. I like coding, and I like science. But mostly I like to learn. Be sure to check out my [earlier work](/index.html).

Before web development, I earned my BS in civil engineering from Cornell University. There, I worked as a researcher simulating internal gravity waves. (Check out my [APS Fluid Dynamics presentation](/assets/img/APSNov19.pdf)). Since then, I have travelled, worked as a bike mechanic in LA, and worked as a [designer/builder](http://paulrichter.us/) at a small custom furniture company.

Here is my [resume]({{pageInfo.resumeLink}}). Email me if you have good problems.
